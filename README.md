# On progress project.
## Clases
- **Graph**: Handles interactions with the nodes as a group.
- **Canvas**: A basic class that abstract ncurses and adds some extra functions.
## Implementations
- Bresenham's Line Algorithm.
- Node Printing.
- Connecting two nodes with a line.
> The current code sets up the nodes in a random position, just for testing purposes.
## Future Implementations.
- Force simulation. (Hooke's Law).
- Pam view to move the nodes.
- Console prompt to operate on the selected node.

## Some ideas.
- Posible solution: Create a connections by colors and forces without the lines.
> I hate how the connection lines looks.
